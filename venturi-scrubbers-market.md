<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Venturi Scrubbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Type</li><li>Jet Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Venturi scrubbers are pollution control devices used to remove airborne particulates and gases from industrial emissions. The market for these scrubbers primarily includes two types: Standard Type and Jet Type. Standard Type Venturi scrubbers utilize a converging-diverging nozzle to create a high-velocity gas flow that captures contaminants through centrifugal force. In contrast, Jet Type Venturi scrubbers employ high-pressure jets to enhance the scrubbing action, making them effective for more challenging applications. Both types are key in achieving environmental compliance.</p></p>
